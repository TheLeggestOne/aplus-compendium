# DnD Game Rule Instructions

- Always anchor features in the 2014-era Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition ruleset. Favor the Players Handbook / Basic Rules / SRD references, especially https://5thsrd.org/, when describing mechanics rather than later errata or modern reprints.
- When asked to implement or describe game-facing components (spells, class features, equipment, etc.), double-check the relevant 2014 reference material before coding; mention which section or rule you relied on so the implementation mirrors the official feel.
- If you need clarity about a rule, note it explicitly and cite the applicable PHB or SRD chapter/page so the user can verify.
- Treat this doc as the primary authority for any feature that touches on character creation, combat, or spells; confirm compliance with it before moving forward.
